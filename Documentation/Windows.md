**Issue #1
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found**

**OS -** Windows 10

**Reason -** As per TF's Release Notes for 2.1.0. Officially-released Tensorflow Pip packages are now built with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 in order to take advantage of the new /d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions compiler flag. 

To use these new packages, you must install "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019", available from Microsoft's website here.

**Solution -** If you are facing this after Tensorflow 2.1.0, it is probably because Tensorflow (CPU version) comes with GPU support by default. And it requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015/17/19 as shown in the installation step #1 on the website.

**Issue #2 - Win10: AttributeError: 'RepeatedCompositeFieldContainer' object has no attribute 'append'**

**OS -** Windows 10

**Reason -** For binaries, the PIP dependency is protobuf >= 3.9.2. The same can be referred from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/setup.py#L64)

**Solution -** Run pip install -U protobuf to install latest version of protobuf
