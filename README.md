# Introduction

![Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Tensorflow 2020](Media/Images/paper_1_architecture.png)

_Fig 1. Proposed architecture ([Source](https://airccj.org/CSCP/vol7/csit77505.pdf "Source"))_

In this project we will a network based on the proposed architecture in the [Acute Leukemia Classification Using Convolution Neural Network In Clinical Decision Support System](https://airccj.org/CSCP/vol7/csit77505.pdf "Acute Leukemia Classification Using Convolution Neural Network In Clinical Decision Support System") paper, built using Tensorflow 2.

**This project is compatible with the Acute Lymphoblastic Detection System feature of [HIAS](https://github.com/LeukemiaAiResearch/HIAS "HIAS").**

# DISCLAIMER

These projects should be used for research purposes only. The purpose of the projects is to show the potential of Artificial Intelligence for medical support systems such as diagnosis systems.

Although the classifiers are accurate and show good results both on paper and in real world testing, they are not meant to be an alternative to professional medical diagnosis.

Developers that have contributed to this repository have experience in using Artificial Intelligence for detecting certain types of cancer. They are not a doctors, medical or cancer experts.

Please use this system responsibly.

# ALL-IDB

You need to be granted access to use the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing dataset. You can find the application form and information about getting access to the dataset on [this page](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) as well as information on how to contribute back to the project [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/results.php). If you are not able to obtain a copy of the dataset please feel free to try this tutorial on your own dataset, we would be very happy to find additional AML & ALL datasets.

## ALL_IDB1 

In this project, [ALL-IDB1](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#datasets) is used, one of the datsets from the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing dataset. We will use data augmentation to increase the amount of training and testing data we have.

"The ALL_IDB1 version 1.0 can be used both for testing segmentation capability of algorithms, as well as the classification systems and image preprocessing methods. This dataset is composed of 108 images collected during September, 2005. It contains about 39000 blood elements, where the lymphocytes has been labeled by expert oncologists. The images are taken with different magnifications of the microscope ranging from 300 to 500."

# Classifier

We have tested our model on a number of different hardwares, including Intel® CPUs & NVIDIA GPUs. Results seem to vary between CPU & GPU, and tests show further investigation into seeding and randomness introduced to our network via the GPU software. For reproducible results every time, it is suggested to train on a CPU, although this obviously requires more time.

One method to overcome reproducibility issues and get an good idea of how well our model is behaving on GPU would be to test the model multiple times and take an average. This is one way we will explore our model in the future.

Below are the results from individual training sessions.

# Setup

Follow the guides below to build your Virtual Reality Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System. The classifiers can be used as standalone if required, but this project focuses on the system as a whole.
